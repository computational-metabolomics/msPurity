\title{Using a purityA object, average and filter fragmentation spectra for each XCMS feature within a MS data file}
\usage{
\S4method{averageIntraFragSpectra}{purityA}(
  pa,
  minfrac = 0.5,
  minnum = 1,
  ppm = 5,
  snr = 0,
  ra = 0,
  av = "median",
  sumi = TRUE,
  rmp = FALSE,
  cores = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pa}{object; purityA object}

\item{minfrac}{numeric; minimum ratio of the peak fraction (peak count / total peaks) within each file}

\item{minnum}{numeric; minimum number of times peak is present across fragmentation spectra within each file}

\item{ppm}{numeric; ppm threshold to average within each file}

\item{snr}{numeric; minimum signal-to-noise of the peak within each file}

\item{ra}{numeric; minimum relative abundance of the peak within each file}

\item{av}{character; type of averaging to use (median or mean)}

\item{sumi}{boolean; TRUE if the intensity for each peak is summed across averaged spectra}

\item{rmp}{boolean; TRUE if peaks are to be removed that do not meet the threshold criteria. Otherwise they will just be flagged}

\item{cores}{numeric; Number of cores for multiprocessing}
}
\value{
Returns a purityA object (pa) with the following slots now with data
\itemize{
\item pa@av_spectra: the average spectra is recorded here stored as a list. e.g. "pa@av_spectra$\code{1}$av_intra$\code{1}" would give the average spectra for grouped feature 1 and for file 1.
\item pa@av_intra_params: The parameters used are recorded here
}

Each spectra in the av_spectra list contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item cl: id of clustered (averaged) peak
\item mz: average m/z
\item i: average intensity
\item snr: average signal to noise ratio
\item rsd: relative standard deviation
\item count: number of clustered peaks
\item total: total number of potential scans to be used for averaging
\item inPurity: average precursor ion purity
\item ra: average relative abundance
\item frac: the fraction of clustered peaks (e.g. the count/total)
\item snr_pass_flag: TRUE if snr threshold criteria met
\item minfrac_pass_flag: TRUE if minfrac threshold criteria
\item ra_pass_flag: TRUE if ra threshold criteria met
\item pass_flag: TRUE if all threshold criteria met
}
}
\description{
\strong{General}

Average and filter fragmentation spectra for each XCMS feature within a MS data file.

The averaging is performed using hierarchical clustering of the m/z values of each peaks, where m/z values within a set ppm tolerance will be clustered. The clustered peaks are then averaged (or summed).

The fragmentation can be filtered on the averaged spectra (with the arguments snr, rsd, minfrac and ra)
